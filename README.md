# RPSLS_Csharp

This console application is an adaptation of "Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock", a variation of "Rock-Paper-Scissors" from the show The Big Bang Theory. This particular project - an assignment for devCodeCamp - is actually a clone of a previous project. The original project was written in Python, but the task for this version was to migrate it over to C#. It was a very helpful exercise, and most likely something I'd revisit when learning other new languages.
